
## Welcome to the intuitive Digital Signal Processing (iDSP) Project
iDSP repo mains branch

This page gathers *reactive* material for developing *intuition* in *Digital Signal Processing*.

The material exposed here is organized into a list of figures which are usually proposed statically in textbooks, leaving considerable mental work on the student side to go from figure to concept (work which professors hope to alleviate by describing their own mental pictures in terms of complex equations, supported by -often ambiguous- words, if not by gestures :)).

For each figure, we make our best to propose pointers to: 
1. **Reactive tools**, which are the heart if the project. They are webapps which require no specific installation to run. Tools augment the figure with reactive components which involve students in the understanding of the concept. Tools are open source.
2. **Videos**, which show how tools can be used to activate the figure. Tthey are ideally snapshots of the tools, without spoken comments so as to let professors comment by themselves. Videos are creative commons;
3. **Code**, available for students with technical background to check how concepts are implemented and possibly build on this implementation. At best, code comes from the tools themselves.

This material is taken from third parties when available (with their own licenses), or built on purpose.
