## Welcome to the iDSP Project

This page contains reactive *web-based* material for developing *intuition* in *Digital Signal Processing*.
The material exposed here is organized into a lit of figures which are usually proposed statically in textbooks, leaving mental work on the student side.
For each figure, we propose pointers to videos, tools, and code which provide progressive insights into the conepts aimed to be exposed in the original figure.
